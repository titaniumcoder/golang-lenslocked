# Go! Tutorial Lenslocked

This is just me doing the tutorial from [https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_wdv2]() with some adaption and extensions to see how good
I am with golang.

## Extensions / Going "off" from the tutorial

- Database: I want to use Supabase for this
- Auth: While the tutorial uses password authentication, I will keep it in the code for demo purposes, but the app will only have
  * OAuth
  * Passwordless
- Storage of photos
  * I will use an S3 storage for this
- Frontend / Backend
  * Backend: Go and Rest
  * Frontend: I want to add some dynamics using htmx may be svelte but more for preparing the build
- Deploy / run
  * provider: not yet sure
  * Action: Github Actions
